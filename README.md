>Development on GalliumOS has been discontinued, and for most users, GalliumOS is not the best option for running Linux due to lack of hardware support or a kernel that's out of date and lacking important security fixes.

>For most (EOL) Chromebooks, the recommended path forward is to:
>
>put the device into Developer Mode
>disable firmware write protection
>flash MrChromebox's UEFI Full ROM firmware
>install ChromeOS Flex, Linux, etc
